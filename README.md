# A Look at Botulism Through History

This project uses historical data from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/index.html) to analyze trends in Botulism in the United States since 1897.  

Through using SQLite, Flask, and web development languages HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this project presents a complete report webpage when the Flask app is run.  All charts on the page are dynamic and responsive.  Snapshots of the deployed site are below.
